# Hello World
This is my first post on my blog.
This blog will mostly be a technical journal of my projects.
For some blogs I will also provide youtube videos as tutorials or/and demonstrations.



I am using [Jekyll][jekyll] to create this website, heres my [repo][repo].



Heres an example of the code section.

{% highlight ruby %}
greeting = 'Hello world'

for letter in greeting:
  print(letter)
{% endhighlight %}
